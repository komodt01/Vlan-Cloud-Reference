# VLAN Simulation in Public Cloud Providers

This repository provides a side-by-side overview of how VLAN concepts translate into modern public cloud platforms ‚Äî AWS, Azure, and GCP. While traditional VLAN tagging (802.1Q) is not natively supported within these platforms, each provider offers ways to simulate VLAN-like segmentation using cloud-native constructs.
